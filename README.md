# hello_world
To start GiHub and learn
I came to thi stuff cause I had issue to start Docker for Windows. As I was consulting Docker FAQs this leads me to Git Issues knwoledge base wher I found similar issue as mine. Wanting to comment, I was invited to sign in for a GitHub account. It is how I a currently learning with GitHub
I am not a regular developer, but rather a project manager or project coordinator. But I am still intested in doing episodic development if I can.
Not effective changes. But just creating a branch.
I put some logs to track my progress
